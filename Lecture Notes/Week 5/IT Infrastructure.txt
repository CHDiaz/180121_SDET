IT Infrastructure
The combination of software, hardware platforms and services required to mae a functional IT environment

Hardware
Servers
Computers
Routers

Software
Office
applications
executables

Network
Shared internal connections
intranet
firewall and security measures

Cloud Computing
Having all/most IT needs on a server that we can utilize

Software             Platform              Infrastructure
Office		Runtime Environment		Processors
Email client	Web servers			Operating Systems
		Application servers		
		RDBMS				

PAAS
Offering development tools and environment
Using JDK, Web Servers, Application servers

SAAS
Salesforce
Hewlett Packard-ALM
OFfice

IAAS
handle system maintenance, backups
and structure reliability
Highly scalable resources that can
be adjusted on the fly
Processors, OS and hard drives

Amazon Web Services
Large selection of computer services provided on the cloud
Provides these services via 'availability zones'
discrete data center locations
where users can connect for services
located at core parts of the world
there can be multiple availability zones in a region

Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2)
Virtual machine on the cloud
Pay only for what you use
A virtual machine that has its own hardrive (EBS) and OS (AMI)
We will use a linux AMI where we will SSH into it

Elastic Block Store (EBS)
Provides a persistent block level storage for EC2
sort of like a hardrive
High speed data transfer between EC2 and EBS
secure and encrypted
essentially the hard drive to your EC2
EC2 attaches to an EBS

Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
The OS for an EC2

Auto-Scaling groups
Ensure you have enough EC2 to handle application load
decrease/increase EC2 count as load increases/decreases
Can set max/min amount of EC2's

Elastic Load Balances (ELB)
A component for distributing incoming traffic to other EC2's
to ensure one does not get overloaded
Aim to check current capacity of EC2's and react accordingly

Relation Database Service (RDS)
Database on the cloud
Support for Oracle, SQL Server, Aurora, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB

Simple Storage Service (S3)
File server/storage
Secure and durable
Store backup files
Disaster recovery

Route 53 (R53)
Amazon provides unique DNS - Domain Naming System
Provides DNS for all of the separate EC2's
Does health checks on EC2's

Access Identity Manager (AIM)
Manages / creates accounts with varying rates for
access to your AWS Resources

Development Operations (DevOps)
Role that combines development with project operations
Automation of processes for project testing and deployment
Achieved through continuous integration and continuous deployment

Continuous Integration & Deployment
The secret to DevOps
Continuously pushing code
Continuously testing pushed code
Continuously deploying tested code
Why?
-Exposes bugs faster
-Finding bugs fast -> smaller bugs -> faster fixes
-Ensuring tests are always passing
never go home with failed tests

Verification
Am I doing the right thing

Validation
Did I do the right right

CI Goals
Maintain a single source code repository
Automate builds
	builds should be self testing
keeps build fast
test environments should be near perfect mimic
of the production environment
Constant automated notifications

Continuous Development / Continuous Integration
Source Code Manager (GitHub)
Continuous Integration Server (EC2, Jenkins, JDK, Maven)
Quality Gate Server (SonarQube)
Dev Server (Tomcat, JDK)
Production Server (EC2, Tomcat, JDK)

1. Developers push code to SCM
2. Jenkins detects change in SCM
3. Jenkins pulls up to date code
4. Jenkins uses Maven to build the application (compiling and unit testing the code)
5. Send code to quality gate (SonarQube)
6. Deploy to dev server, perform test automation, smoke tests, regression testing, e2e testing
7. Deploy to the production server, send notification of success to all teams

Note: If at any point a test, quality check or deployment fails, the whole process is aborted and team notified

Jenkins
-Continuous Integration Tool
Jenkins is a forked version of Hudson
Ultimately, Jenkins is better than Hudson
has more build pushes than hudson
has significantly less build errors
open source
