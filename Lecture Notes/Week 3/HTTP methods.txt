GET
Send encoded user info appended to the page request
URL separates into '?': url?key=value&key2=val2
URL size limited to 1024 bytes - risk of passing too much info
Stored in a key called "Query_String" in the request file

POST
Same as get, but instead of a string in the URL it sends info in the body of the request
