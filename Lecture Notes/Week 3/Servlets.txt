Servlets
A java servlet is a program that runs on a web/application server that acts as a middleman between
a request from a client (browser) and databases or applications
Allows us to collect input from forms, present records from a DB, or create web pages dynamically

Client (browser)
 -> Request to server. 
A request is simply a flat file (no extension)
with details of the request 
-> Server takes request, creates an empty
response file and sends both to the Web Container
-> web container checks the deployment descriptor to determine which servlet
gets to handle this request
-> Web container wraps the request and response as java objects
WC then sends both objects to the specified servlet
-> If servlet is not instantiated, call init() for servlet
-> Call the service method to handle the requests
-> Servlet passes altered response and request object back to web container
-> Web container unwraps objects and sends request + response to server
-> Server passes request and response back to client who displays response


Client browser -> server -> web container reads web.xml -> servlets 
-> eg Servlet A (init(), service(), destroy()) -> thread pool (T1, T2, T3) -> web container

Servlet Tasks
Read explicit data from the client (form data)
Read metadata from the client (head tag)
Processes data and generates a result
