Thursday Transactions

An atomic unit of work on a database

What are the properties of a transaction

Atomicity
- All or nothing
- If at any point a transaction fails, the operation is aborted and rolled back

Consistency
- Any transcation must adhere to the rules of a DV
- State of a DB is always valid

Isolation
- No transaction should alter the result of another if ran concurrently
- Expected results should be the same if transactions were ran sequentially vs concurrently

Durability
- All successful transactions must be persistent
- If a DB fails, the data should never last lost

Transaction Isolation Levels		 Dirty Reads	non Repeatable Reads	Serialization
Read uncommitted			      X			X		      X
Read committed	(oracle default)	     	 		X		      X
repeatable reads			      	 				      X	
Serializable (table lock)				      	 					

Dirty Read
Any moment where a transaction pulls data from another transaction's uncommitted changes

Non Repeatable Reads
- Whenever a transaction pulls different data from the same query during the same transaction

Phantom Read
-If I perform the query twice in one transaction and I get more/les records than last time

Oracle has an extension called PL/SQL (Procedural language Stuctured Query Language)
It provides tools that we can use with SQL
Such as functions, stored procedures, sequences, and triggers
As well as exception handling
In other words, it provides a means to write actual code in SQL

Sequence
A sequence is an object that will maintain a counter for you

--Difference between stored procedure and function

function cannot do DML
