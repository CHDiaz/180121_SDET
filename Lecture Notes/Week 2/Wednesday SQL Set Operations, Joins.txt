Database Joins
Combining data of 2 tables based on a matching criteria
-Right join. Everything of right with matching from left
-Left join. Everything from left with matching from right
-Inner join. Only matches from both tables
-Full join. All data from both tables combined
-Outer join

Conceptual Joins
- Self joins. Any join on itself
- Cross join. All different combinations of data together
- theta join. Any join performed by NOT using an = comparator
- equi join. Any join using = comparator

- natural join. Removes need for the ON clause for joins
joins 2 tables together based on matching column names
omits duplicate columns from results


Set operations
Operations that combine 2 query results into one
Requires both queries have the same datatypes and order
UNION
UNION ALL
INTERSECT
MINUS
EXCEPT (Not supported by Oracle)

SELECT * FROM T1
SET_OPERATION
SELECT * FROM T2;

Union
- Combines both queries data into one
- Omits duplicates
UNION ALL
-Exact same as Union but includes duplicates

INTERSECT VS INNER JOIN interview question
-Combines 2 queries while omitting any data that is unique to either query

MINUS
-Only gives data of top query omitting matching data of bottom query

EXCEPT
Opposite of intersect
