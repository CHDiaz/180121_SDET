Indices

Provides a means to distinctly identify records

Allow for faster retrieval of data from a table
at a cost of increased DML times

2 types: clustered & non-clustered

Clustered index
implicit index
Made automatically when you create a PK / unique
Uses actual data of the table to index it

Non-clustered index
explicit
can make it for any column
creates an object that uses its own manner of identifying each record uniquely
more indices

Online Analytic Processing (OLAP)
Aim to denormalize the DB
Used not for transcations but for data mining
Typically stays in 1NF or 2NF

Online transactional processing (OLTP)
Aims to design a database that can quickly perform need transactions
and grab neccessary data for application use
Aim for 3NF

Dimension Tables
-tables that store all stats of transactions

Fact tables
Provides aggregated of the dimension tables

Star Schema
D - Store A sales

D - Store B sales

D - store X sales

Facts table in the middle

Allows for less complex queries
has more redundant data, more memory required

Datawarehouse
All data on all transactions for a company
Datamart would be a more localized subset of that data

Snowflake schema
Every dimension table has one connection either to Facts table 
or a dimension table
Requires more complex queries
Less data redundancy
Typically used for datawarehouses
