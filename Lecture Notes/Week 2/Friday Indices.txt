Indices

Provides a means to distinctly identify records

Allow for faster retrieval of data from a table
at a cost of increased DML times

2 types: clustered & non-clustered

Clustered index
implicit index
Made automatically when you create a PK / unique
Uses actual data of the table to index it

Non-clustered index
explicit
can make it for any column
creates an object that uses its own manner of identifying each record uniquely
