Components of JDBC Driver Manager (interview question)
list of all database drivers

Driver
interface that handles communications with DB

Connection
All communications with a database rest solely within this database

Statements
These are objects that are used to submit SQL statements to the DB

Resultset
Objects that store data retrieved from the DB

SQL Exceptions
Exceptions for handling SQL errors

Statements
-Statement
	- General purpose access to your database
	- static sql statements at runtime
	- SQL injection possible

Prepared Statements - precompiled, checks if table exists, confirms table types, parses for correct syntax, caches query
- more dynamic
- parameterized
- accepts input runtime
- prevent sql injection
- prepared statements check that it is one single statement

Normalization
Database design technique for removing duplicate data and redundancies
In addition to this it aims to decrease data dependencies

ONF Zeroth normal form
- a database with no normalization
- a denormalized database

1NF
-All data must be atomic. Smallest form
-Each record must be unique

2NF
- Be in first normal form
- No composite keys for unique ID

3NF (what we need to know. Anything beyond is company standard)
- Be in 2nd normal form
- No transitive dependencies

BCNF (3.5NF) (Boyce Codd Normal Form)

4NF 5NF 6NF 7,8,9
