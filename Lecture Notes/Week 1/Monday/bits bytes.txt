What is Java
OOP programming language
fast, reliable, secure programming language
One of the main goals of java is portability
Java applications run similarily on any combination of hardware and platform / operating systems "Write once run anywhere"
Achieved by compiling java language code to java byte code
Java byte code is readable by JVM Java Virtual Machine
JVM works on top of an OS to provide an environment
-Can only read java byte code
Java runtime environment
-Contains EVERYTHING required to run a java application including JVM and all compiled files needed to run java
Java Development Kit JDK
- includes all libraries needed to develop java applications
- provides the java compiler, javadocs, jars (java archive file) and the debugger
JDK includes JRE includes JVM

Stack vs Heap

Stack      
bottom     
 ----      
 ----      
 ----      
 ----      
 ----      
 top
local variables and function calls
one stack per thread
no 2 stacks reference each other's local variables

Heap       
*drawn like a mess*
- store objects
- string pool inside the heap
- instance variables (global variable)
- static variable
