SDET - Software Development Engineer in Test
Tester must be very skilled at programming

guru99 - great website for testing, manual and automated

Develop frameworks / applications that handle other applications
to handle their functionality automatically

Develop testing frameworks for automating applications
in order to ensure they function correctly

Frameworks are typically written in Java (selenium webdriver)
or typescript/javascript (Protractor)

Automation testing
Any testing that utilizes automated scripts
that run through an application and generates detailed reports
of test results

Manual testing
A tester manually performs actions on an application
and documents results as compared to requirements

Unit testing: most micro of testing (developer)
Integration testing: multiple methods together (developer)
System Integration testing (developer / tester)
User acceptance testing - last testing

User acceptance testing categories:
1. Alpha testing
	- Application is tested in-house by staff of IT
2. Beta testing
	- Application tested out of house by possible consumers

Regression Testing
Testing old functionality to ensure new functionality didnt break old functionality

Smoke testing (Sanity testing)
Any testing done to see if the application even works
Simple login
Do pages even show?

Positive testing
Does the expected result occur when the proper action executes
Does the right thing happen when the right action occurs
The happy path - any testing with the perfect user
Correct login details yield a logged in user

Negative testing
Does the expected result occur when an improper action executes
Incorrect login details yield an error message

Functional Testing
Any testing done for validating
actual functionality of an application

Non-functional testing
Testing performed on the metrics and states of a application
performance testing
- load - typical use on heavy traffic day
- stress - approach capacity and go past it
- spike 2 - 1000 users all at once
- ramp up / ramp down - gradually more users or gradually less users

Security testing
Malicious use
penetration testing

Entry criteria
Tasks to be satisfied in order to begin a phase
Plan documentation

Exit Criteria
Tasks to be complete before a phase is considered finished
Summary documentation

Test Plan
Documentation of how a team intends to test a specific application
What will be teseted
How long will each test phase be?
Who will be testing?

Test Strategy
A document detailing strategies for testing
What do we do when we find a bug?
What formats are followed for test documentation
May be applied to multiple projects

LOE - Level of Effort
Test plan - 4 h
Test strategy - 4 h
SiT - depends on application size 80 hours
Regression - 80 hours
UAT - 60h
Summary - 3

Knowledge Transfer (KT)

Requirements Traceability Matrix
A document that shows requirements coverage by test case
as well as whether or not the test case passed

Test Case Document

Test suite contains test cases

Defect - an implemented functionality does not meet a requirement
Therefore yielded a bug/fault/failure

Fault
Is the portion of a program that caused the abnormality
Result of miscommunication or misunderstanding

Bug
The line of codes that caused our defect

Error
Incorrect code itself

Failure
defect that made it to production

e2e testing
Testing application from start to finish
Can I successfully finish a full user interaction from start to finish

Black Box Testing
Testing an application without being able to reference its code

White box
Referencing its code
