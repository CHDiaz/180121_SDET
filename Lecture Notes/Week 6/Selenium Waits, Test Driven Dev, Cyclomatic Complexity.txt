Selenium waits

Implicit waits
Applied to the whole driver
Sets how long a driver waits to find any element before declaring the test failed

Explicit waits
A specific object designed to wait for a specific action
Can be applied to a specific step for the driver
You can set how long to wait
Note: during waits, driver checks for condition every 1/2 second

Fluent waits
Works like explicit wait
but you can also customize how often the driver checks for the condition

TDD
Test Driven Development
Developers write test first, then write application
Write test first, execute tests, tests fail, implement application
until tests pass
PRO: Full test coverage by end of application
CON: If a requirement change demands a code change, you have to
change a test suite as well as the application

Cyclomatic Complexity
A measurement of how complex it is to test a given application
based off how many different paths and states a program can have when running
Number of linearly independent paths

BDD - Behavioural Driven Development
Same concept as TDD
Tests are written in a business readable language
PRO: BAs or other non developer roles can write tests that can be implemented
by developers
PRO: Tests also serve as direct user stories

Cucumber - BDD tool
Cucumber allows us to write tests in a business readable language
that can be later implemented in code
The language that cucumber uses is called Gherkin
Gherkin is compatabile with 60+ human languages
