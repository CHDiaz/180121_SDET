Routing is a feature that Angular uses to achieve true
single page application format (SPA)

Routing is where we set up a tag that will take injections of separate html
code/pages dynamically. This lets the user stay on the same page,
while new content is replaced throughout navigation
The pages and content get cached client side so that the user does not need
to hit the server for new pages or old ones

Worth noting: The caching utilizes browser bookmarks to maintain page history
This allows us to use the back/forward buttons on the page even though,
technically, the page is never actually changed
