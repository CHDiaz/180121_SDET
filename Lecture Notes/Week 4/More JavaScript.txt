Prototypical inheritance
Objects inherit traits & features from a base implementation --the prototype

Constructor
Invoking 'new' on a function will use it as an object constructor
That constructor is then used as the prototype for all objects made
from that constructor

e1 = new emp('bob',22);

emp.prototype.age = 44;

e1.age
->44
