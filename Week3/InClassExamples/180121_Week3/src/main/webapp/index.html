	<h1>HTML (Hypertext Mark-up Language)</h1>
	<p>Everything in HTML is done using tags. This is how a markup language is formatted.
	Different tags perform different actions. The above header is done using the &lt;h1&gt; tag.</p>
	<p>Another paragraph!</p>
	<p>You can use &lt;br&gt; to perform line breaks.<br>So<br>Words<br>are<br>Separated</p>

	<p>Horizontal rules are Ryan's favorite</p>
	<hr>
	<p style="color:blue">Any tag can be called an element. An key value pairs within the element are called
	attributes.</p>
	<p>Hypertext Markup languages are used to help a browser render content on screen. There is
	no compilation, it is all interpreted. (Means that the code, as is, is used to display
	content)</p>

	<p><b>SIDE NOTE:</b> In order to have links to other pages, you need to make use of the
