		<p>With radio button types, you can have multiple radio buttons that may be toggled.
		However, in order to enforce that only one of a specific group can be toggeled, you need
		to ensure they each ahve the same name. Since the rule goes: Only one radio button of the 
		same named group may be toggled at a time. The value attribute is used to store which one
		is toggled.
