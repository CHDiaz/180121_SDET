    <h1>DIRECTIVES</h1>
    <p>Directives are ways taht we can invoke Angular functionality
        within an html file. They act as syntax that can be used in html
        format without breaking the front end.
    </p>
    <!--NOTE: When in doubt, you can identify an angular directive by observing that
        they typically start with 'ng' in name. -->

    <h3>*ngIf</h3>
    <div class="well" style="background-color:beige">
        <p>What does the asterisk(*) mean in front of the ngIf?</p>
        <input type="button" (click)=toggleAnswer() [value]="buttonValue">
        <p *ngIf="visible;else someTemplate">
            Any directive that has an asterisk(*) means that is is a 
            structural directive. This means the directive is capable of changing
            the actual structure of the HTML itself. IE, it can add/remove elements
            on the page.
        </p>
        <ng-template #someTemplate>
            <p style="color:red">GOTTA SHOW THAT ANSWER!</p>
        </ng-template>
    </div>
    <div class="well" style="background-color:azure">
        <h3>*ngFor</h3>
        <p>*ngFor is a directive that can add elements based off of some
            count of items from a array. For each item we can create a duplicate
            representation of the tag and children tags we apply it to. With the data
            being different thanks to data binding.
            (Since this is changing the structure of out HTML page, we can call this
            a structural directive.)
