    <h3>String Interpolation</h3>
    <p>Angular uses a concept called data binding.
        This boils down to how we can connect our front end (View) to our backends. (Components)
        Any data in our components needs to have a way to be transferred to the view.
        One way to do this, is to use String Interpolation
    </p>
    <div>The value of some componentVariable is: <b style="color:red">{{componentVariable}}</b></div>

    <p>The above example demonstrated pulling information from the component directly.  We took the data and displaye it on the html.  Using the double brackets as provided by angular wee can display it to the view.  The transfer of data from the component to the HTML is called model. </p>
    <p>
        We can use interpolation like a form of expression language.
        You can evaluate entities within it.<br>
        2 + 2 = {{2+2}}...
    </p>

    <p>This was an example of one-way data binding.  It is only capable of bringing data from the component to the view.  Not vice vera.</p>
    <p>Another data-binding option we have is called 'property binding'</p>
    <p>Property binding is technique where we can make the value of some element property equal to a result as defined in the typescript file.</p>
    <p>String interpolation is useful for evaluation data from the backend and displaying it on the front end. 
        Property binding is used to take values from the backend and apply them as properties for the elements.
