This application has a user login and registration.
It includes depositing, withdrawing, and viewing amount in the database. It also has persisting data functionality.

The way I structured the application by using states. The application has 5 states USER_LOGIN, USER_CREATE, 
USER_LOGOUT, USER_PROMPT, and USER_PROFILE.
